# Project Title: Diabetes Patients Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analysing a dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The goal is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements. The dataset consists of medical predictor variables and a binary outcome variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

## Dataset Details
- **Source:** National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases
- **Format:** CSV
- **Variables:**
  - **Independent Variables (Medical Predictor Variables):**
    - Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes, and Age are all independent variables.
  - **Dependent Variable (Target):**
    - Outcome (Binary: 0 or 1) is the only dependent variable in this analysis.

## Tasks Performed

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Data Overview:** The dataset contains 768 rows and 9 columns.
- **Variable Analysis:** Exploring the distribution and characteristics of the independent and dependent variables.

### Data Cleaning
- **Handling Missing Values:** Addressing any missing values in the dataset. There were no missing values in the dataset.
- **Data Transformation:** EDA was performed to get an overview of the data.

### Data Visualisation
- **Correlation Analysis:** Visualising relationships between variables, especially those related to diabetes diagnosis.
- **Distribution Plots:** Creating plots to show the distribution of key variables.

### Model Building (if applicable)
- If the project involves building a predictive model, details on the model selection, training, and evaluation are provided.

## How to Run the Analysis
1. **Dependencies:** [List any dependencies or libraries required to run the analysis]
2. **Instructions:** Provide step-by-step instructions on how to execute the analysis.

## Results
Summarise key findings and insights obtained from the analysis.

## Future Work
Outline potential future steps or enhancements for the project.
